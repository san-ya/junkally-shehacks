# JunkAlly
<i>Head over to https://junkally.herokuapp.com/ to witness it in action!</i>

## Inspiration
Believe it or not, we drew our inspiration from waste! After having realised our huge role in plundering our environment we decided to not only try to give it up but also help others alleviate this by doing their role. We were inspired from this need to not let our consumerist natures completely destroy our beautiful environment.


## Overview
Our project, JunkAlly, acts as a bridge between small businesses/NGOs (who upcycle/recycle waste) and us consumers (notorious for generating the waste). It does so, by arranging for a pick up from the users for their waste and delivering them with our partners. The small businesses and NGOs get their material and the users, in turn for their initiative, get points in accordance with the weight of the waste that they've submitted which they can avail to get vouchers and discount coupons from our partners.


## Walk-through of JunkAlly
To walk you through our website, we’ve prepared a detailed step-by-step procedure on how to go about using it.

**Landing Page**

At the top of the website, find the navbar which has the options of directing you to –
1.	Home (i.e., the landing page)
2.	Process (a detailed chalked out path)
3.	Steps

    a.	Steps to follow as a user
    
    b.	Steps to follow as a small business
    
4.	Login (as a small business or as a consumer)
5.	Register (to join us on the path of sustainability!)
As you scroll down the landing page, we’ve incorporated our motivation behind JunkAlly i.e. Why Recycle
Right now, we’re mainly targeting the 4 materials namely Metal, Glass, Paper, and Plastic

Our footer, includes the links to our social media handles, our contact details, our address, and a couple of useful links for the ease of navigation.

**Process Page**

In an aim to be transparent, we have listed out all the steps right from where the user raises a request to make a submission to point where the materials that they’ve given, have been approved and the points accredited to their database.

**Steps Page**

Here, we’ve listed out the steps that each entity (i.e. the consumers and the businesses) accessing our website should follow to make the most out of JunkAlly.
After registering yourself on the “Register” page, head over to login to view the role-appropriate dashboard (admin/user).

**User Dashboard**

The user dashboard is designed to help users(consumers) sell recyclable materials like glass bottle, plastic bottles, metal and paper. They can fill in the required information about the material and easily get rid of these wastes in an eco-friendly manner. In exchange, the users also receive reward points!

**Company Dashboard**

The company dashboard helps small businesses connect with us. They can buy the required material from our junk inventory at much cheaper rates.

It's a win-win situation for all!

## JunkAlly
JunkAlly was born after having observed the pillaging that humans have inflicted on our environment, especially in the recent times. While one-time-use plastic notoriety is only increasing (and rightfully so), other crucial elements of our plunder remain out of the limelight.
JunkAlly acts as a bridge between the consumers (the generators of waste) and small businesses (which have the initiative and the resources to upcycle/recycle the said waste). It does so by connecting its users and the small businesses via an efficient point system whereby for every certain kilograms of waste that the user gives to the businesses, they acquire a set value of points which they can later redeem to avail discounts at the outlets of such small businesses. This way the businesses acquire material to create sustainable products and also get to reach a larger customer base while the customer is able to do their bit in contributing towards improving the environment while also receiving exciting discounts.
Through JunkAlly, we aim to efficiently employ the 3 important R’s (and more) and we believe that it has the potential to become a one-stop platform to alleviate excess and promote sustainability.
